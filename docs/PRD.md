# Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## Introduction
The CI/CD Pipeline for Data Processing Infrastructure is designed to automate the deployment and management of distributed data processing systems, with a focus on web scraping, data streaming, and database management. The system provides a robust infrastructure for collecting, processing, and storing large volumes of data while ensuring reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

## Features

### Data Pipeline Features
- **Scrapy Spiders**: Auto-scaling web scraping capabilities
- **Kafka Streaming**: Real-time data processing and distribution
- **Data Storage**:
  - MongoDB for flexible raw data storage
  - PostgreSQL for structured processed data
  - Redis for caching and job queues
- **API Layer**: RESTful endpoints for data access and monitoring

### CI/CD Features
- Automated testing for data pipelines
- Docker containerization with volume management
- Kubernetes orchestration for distributed systems
- Multiple environment configurations
- Database migration automation
- Monitoring for data quality and pipeline health
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Architecture Overview

### Data Flow
1. Data Collection → Kafka Topics → Stream Processors → Data Storage → API Layer
2. Redis Cache → API Layer for improved performance

### Key Components
- **Data Collection Layer**: Scrapy spiders
- **Stream Processing Layer**: Kafka and stream processors
- **Data Storage Layer**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **API Layer**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Kubernetes, Docker, monitoring systems

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- Kubernetes cluster
- Kafka cluster
- MongoDB instance
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis instance

### Development Environment
- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes CLI tools
- Kafka CLI tools

### Monitoring and Observability
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Alerting system for pipeline health

## Development Process

### Version Control
- Git-based workflow with feature branches
- Code reviews and pull requests

### Continuous Integration
- Automated testing pipeline
- Code quality checks
- Build automation

### Continuous Deployment
- Automated deployment to multiple environments
- Canary releases and rollback capabilities
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) practices

## Deployment Strategy

### Environments
1. **Development**: Local development environment with Docker Compose
2. **Staging**: Pre-production environment for testing
3. **Production**: Live environment with auto-scaling

### Deployment Process
1. Code changes are pushed to feature branches
2. Automated tests run in CI pipeline
3. Approved changes are merged to main branch
4. Automated deployment to staging environment
5. Manual approval for production deployment
6. Monitoring and rollback capabilities in place

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Pipeline health monitoring
- Data quality metrics
- System performance tracking
- Regular security audits
